## Question 1: User Profile List

### Key Concepts:

1. JSX for Rendering 
   JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows HTML-like code to be written within JavaScript. It defines the layout of React components, with React internally converting JSX into `React.createElement()` calls.

2. Virtual DOM and React DOM
   The Virtual DOM is an in-memory representation of the actual DOM. React uses the Virtual DOM to efficiently update the user interface by comparing the differences between the previous and current states of the DOM and applying minimal changes to the real DOM using the React DOM.

3. Dynamic Rendering
   The user profiles are rendered dynamically, with React re-rendering the list whenever a new profile is added. This can be achieved using the `map()` function to iterate over the user data array and render each profile.

4. Form to Add New Users
   A form allows users to input new profiles, with React managing form data through controlled components (inputs whose value is controlled by React’s state). When the form is submitted, the new profile is added dynamically to the list.

5. Unique Keys for List Items
   Each list item is assigned a unique `key` prop. This helps React identify items that have changed, been added, or removed, optimizing performance by minimizing unnecessary re-renders.

6. Conditional Rendering
   A message like "No users available" is displayed when the list is empty. This is achieved through conditional rendering, which checks if the user list is empty before deciding what to render.

# Question 2: Product Details Component

### Key Concepts

1. Managing State
   Product details, such as name, price, and description, are stored in the component’s state using hooks like `useState()`. When the state is updated, React re-renders the component with the updated product details.

2. Methods to Update Product Details
   A method is created to update the product details when a button is clicked. This triggers a state update, which causes React to re-render the component and display the updated product information.

3. Passing Methods as Props
   Functions such as the update method are passed from parent to child components as props. This allows the child component to trigger state changes in the parent component, updating the product details from within the child component.

4. PropTypes for Validation
   PropTypes are used to validate the types of props passed to components. For example, strings can be enforced for the product name and numbers for the price. This ensures type safety and prevents bugs.

5. State vs. Props  
   State refers to data local to a component that can be updated, while props are immutable data passed from a parent to a child component. In this case, product details are managed in the parent component’s state and passed to child components as props for display.
